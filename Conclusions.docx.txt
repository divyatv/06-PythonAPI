Objective is to show the effects of weather as one goes closer to the equator.
My objective is to build a series of scatter plots to showcase the following relationships:

* Temperature (F) vs. Latitude
* Humidity (%) vs. Latitude
* Cloudiness (%) vs. Latitude
* Wind Speed (mph) vs. Latitude

As final considerations:

* You must complete your analysis using a Jupyter notebook -- done
